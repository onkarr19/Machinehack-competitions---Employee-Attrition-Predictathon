Overview:
Analytics India Magazine is organizing this hackathon in association with MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune, under its flagship program AIM Campus Program. The primary aim of this hackathon is to make the students able to build powerful machine learning models in a competitive challenge and give recognition to the talented students.

This hackathon, named "Employee Attrition Predictathon", is being conducted by MachineHack - India's leading machine learning competitive platform and a brand of Analytics India Magazine. This hackathon is specifically conducted for the participants from the MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune, where all the students having an interest in machine learning can take part in it.

Attrition of employees is a severe challenge across all organizations. There are different factors that cause the employees to leave the job. If the management has the awareness in advance that an employee may quit the job, corrective measures can be taken in advance to manage the risk due to attrition. This hackathon tries to address this problem faced by employers by making the advance prediction of an employee on the risk of attrition.

In this hackathon, the participants will be given the dataset comprising different features of the employees along with the information whether the employee has attrited to not. Using other useful features of the employees, the task is to build a machine learning model to make prediction about an employee's attrition.

The submission will be evaluated using the Accuracy Score. One can use '''sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score''' to calculate the same.
